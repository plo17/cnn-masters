This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify eggs into their respective species. 
The project is part of a master's thesis, focusing on the development and training of a deep learning model capable of accurately identifying and categorizing eggs based on their visual characteristics.
The model leverages advanced image processing techniques and neural network architectures to achieve high accuracy in species classification, contributing to the broader field of automated biological classification systems.
